Lit based web components

# install
```npm install```

## setup
```pnpm install```
or
```npm run setup```

If you want to develop more than 1 component at a time and see reflected dependency changes in another component, run your components with ```npm run watch``` to recompile your package on change. This way your changes will be immediately reflected in dependent components.
